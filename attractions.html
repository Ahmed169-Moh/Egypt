              <h1>The pyramids</h1>  
                <p> <small>The Egyptian pyramids are ancient masonry structures located in Egypt. Sources cite at least 118 identified 
                    "Egyptian" pyramids. Approximately 80 pyramids were built within the Kingdom of Kush, now located in the modern
                     country of Sudan. Of those located in modern Egypt, most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs
                      and their consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.</small>
